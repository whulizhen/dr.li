I have a PhD in astrodynamics and space geodesy. My research interests include space vehicle radiation force modelling, precise orbit determination, precise positioning using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and space debris distribution . I have worked on radiation pressure modelling for many spacecraft such as Galileo satellites (European Global Navigation Satellites), Sentinel-1 (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar mission) and Inmarsat-4F2 (with EGNOS payload onboard) spacecraft. Generally, I am interested in using physics and actual observations to find where things are. This has many applications ranging from navigation for pedestrians and vehicles on the street, tracking and navigation for aircraft to the precise trajectory determination for space vehicle in space.

During my master study, I worked on Realtime Kinematic positioning (RTK) and Continuous Operating Reference Station system (CORS). I develoeped the core algorithms used by a project that is aimed to deploy a CORS in Beijing. The test results showed that those algorithms can achieve centimeter positioning accuracy using China's BeiDou system.
