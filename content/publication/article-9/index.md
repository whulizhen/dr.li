abstract = "Solar radiation pressure is one of the main perturbations that needs to be carefully considered for space missions requiring great precision in satellite’s orbit. The computation of solar radiation pressure is related to both satellite’s geometry and surface material. Solar radiation pressure model is usually used in the estimation of satellite’s position in space. However, the quality of solar radiation pressure model is not assessed in a straightforward way. In this study, we proposed an uncertainty analysis on the satellite’s geometry and the surface optical properties using GPS IIR and Galileo FOC spacecraft. We compared the solar radiation pressure between simple box-wing and the detailed geometry model under the condition that the optical properties are set exactly the same. It showed that the average difference in solar radiation pressure caused by satellite geometry is around 6 nm.s^(-2) and 2 nm.s^(-2) for GPS IIR and Galileo FOC satellite. We also found that the irregular shape of satellite can be a source of the so-called “y-bias” in orbit modelling. In addition, the partial derivatives of solar radiation pressure with respect to optical properties for complex satellite geometry are computed using ray tracing. The solar panels are 10 times more sensitive than the satellite bus in solar radiation pressure computation. Furthermore, solar radiation pressure is about 10 times more sensitive to reflectivity than specularity for both solar panels and satellite bus. If we require the standard deviation of SRP be less than 0.1 nm.s^(-2), the standard deviation of optical properties has to be less than 0.001 on solar panels and 0.01 on satellite bus."
