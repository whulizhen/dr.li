abstract = "The principle and application of WiFi indoor positioning are discussed. Taking the location fingerprint matching algorithm as an example, the algorithm and positioning accuracy are analyzed in detail. Based on this, a RSSI matching algorithm based on least squares has been put forward. In the simulation scenario, we test the algorithm in the experiment of static and dynamic positioning. The results show that the positioning accuracy can reach sub-grid level compared to the location fingerprint matching algorithm."
