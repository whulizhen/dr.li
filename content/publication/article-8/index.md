abstract = "We propose a new empirical solar radiation pressure (SRP) model for the Galileo satellites named Direct Radiation pressure Empirical Model with Thermal effect (DREMT). The DREMT is built based on the physics of SRP (simplified box-wing spacecraft geometry and nominal attitude) but can be used as simple as an empirical model in orbit estimation. The model parameters are chosen carefully, considering the trade-offs between model accuracy and the correlation between parameters. We fit the proposed model to a physics-based SRP model from University College London that is computed using ray-tracing techniques and analyze the properties of the fit. In addition, the accelerations for ECOM-1, ECOM-2 and DREMT are reconstructed from their parameters and compared. The results show that DREMT can capture the main characteristics of SRP better than ECOM-1 and ECOM-2 do, especially when the satellite has a lower sun elevation above orbital plane but is not in eclipse. The reconstructed orbit from different analysis centers shows that DREMT can reduce the mean and standard deviation of SLR residuals by 22% and 25%, respectively compared with ECOM-2. Comparisons between DREMT, ECOM-1, and ECOM-2 show that the DREMT has much better performance in orbit prediction than ECOM-1 and ECOM-2 outside of eclipse seasons. With DREMT, the orbit contribution to the Signal In Space Ranging Error (SISRE) is around 48 cm for both the Galileo In Orbit Validation (IOV) and Full Operation Capacity (FOC) satellites over 7-days prediction, which represents 50% improvement compared with ECOM-1 and ECOM-2."
